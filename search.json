Throughout, we will emphasize reproducibility, open science, data visualization, and dynamic document generation. Specific skills learned will include the use of the RStudio integrated development environment, tidy data management practices/workflows, how to get help in programming, and how to use GitHub to track changes in code, disseminate professional work, and integrate feedback. Coursework will consist of lectures, in-class group work, homework, peer assessment, and time for discussion. This course complements graduate-level courses in statistics and quantitative research methods by helping students develop practical skills for conducting independent research incorporating modern data science principles. Students completing this course will have a solid foundation enabling them to handle complex data management tasks and data communication skills for research and professional work.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Testa Statistical Data Analyst Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences ctesta@hsph.harvard.edu https://scholar.harvard.edu/ctesta\nDean Marengi 2nd year PhD Student Department of Environmental Health dean_marengi@g.harvard.edu\nAmanda Hernandez 2nd year Masters Student Department of Environmental Health amandahernandez@hsph.harvard.edu https://github.com/amandabhernandez\nJarvis Chen Lecturer Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences jarvis@hsph.harvard.edu https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jarvischen/\n\n\n<div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\">\n<p><span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-sidebar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Home\">Home</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Syllabus\">Syllabus</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Curriculum\">Curriculum</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 1 — Monday January 9, 2022\">Day 1 — Monday January 9, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 2 — Tuesday January 10, 2022\">Day 2 — Tuesday January 10, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 3 — Wednesday January 11, 2022\">Day 3 — Wednesday January 11, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 4 — Thursday January 12, 2022\">Day 4 — Thursday January 12, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 5 — Friday January 13, 2022\">Day 5 — Friday January 13, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 6 — Tuesday January 17, 2022\">Day 6 — Tuesday January 17, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 7 — Wednesday January 18, 2022\">Day 7 — Wednesday January 18, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 8 — Thursday January 19, 2022\">Day 8 — Thursday January 19, 2022</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 9 — Friday January 20, 2022\">Day 9 — Friday January 20, 2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"quarto-meta-markdown\" class=\"hidden\">\n<p><span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-metatitle\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-twittercardtitle\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-ogcardtitle\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-metasitename\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n</main> <!-- /main -->\n<script id = \"quarto-html-after-body\" type=\"application/javascript\">\nwindow.document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function (event) {\n  const toggleBodyColorMode = (bsSheetEl) => {\n    const mode = bsSheetEl.getAttribute(\"data-mode\");\n    const bodyEl = window.document.querySelector(\"body\");\n    if (mode === \"dark\") {\n      bodyEl.classList.add(\"quarto-dark\");\n      bodyEl.classList.remove(\"quarto-light\");\n    } else {\n      bodyEl.classList.add(\"quarto-light\");\n      bodyEl.classList.remove(\"quarto-dark\");\n    }\n  }\n  const toggleBodyColorPrimary = () => {\n    const bsSheetEl = window.document.querySelector(\"link#quarto-bootstrap\");\n    if (bsSheetEl) {\n      toggleBodyColorMode(bsSheetEl);\n    }\n  }\n  toggleBodyColorPrimary();
