Throughout, we will emphasize\nreproducibility, open science, data visualization, and dynamic document\ngeneration. Specific skills learned will include the use of the RStudio\nintegrated development environment, tidy data management practices/workflows,\nhow to get help in programming, and how to use GitHub to track changes in code,\ndisseminate professional work, and integrate feedback. Coursework will consist\nof lectures, in-class group work, homework, peer assessment, and time for\ndiscussion. This course complements graduate-level courses in statistics and\nquantitative research methods by helping students develop practical skills for\nconducting independent research incorporating modern data science principles.\nStudents completing this course will have a solid foundation enabling them to\nhandle complex data management tasks and data communication skills for research\nand professional work.\n</div>\n\n### Instructional Team \n\n  * <b>Christian Testa</b><br>\n    Statistical Data Analyst<br>\n    Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences<br>\n    <ctesta@hsph.harvard.edu><br>\n    <https://scholar.harvard.edu/ctesta>\n  * <b>Dean Marengi</b><br>\n    2nd year PhD Student<br>\n    Department of Environmental Health<br>\n    <dean_marengi@g.harvard.edu>\n  * <b>Amanda Hernandez</b><br>\n    2nd year Masters Student<br>\n    Department of Environmental Health<br>\n    <amandahernandez@hsph.harvard.edu>\n    <https://github.com/amandabhernandez>\n  * <b>Jarvis Chen</b><br>\n    Lecturer<br>\n    Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences<br>\n    <jarvis@hsph.harvard.edu>\n    <https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jarvischen/>\n\n<iframe>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["lumen","styles.scss"],"title":"ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
