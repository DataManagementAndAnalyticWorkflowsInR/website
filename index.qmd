### Course Description 

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
*Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R* will introduce students to R
programming and modern data management and analysis workflows applied to
examples from population health science. Throughout, we will emphasize
reproducibility, open science, data visualization, and dynamic document
generation. Specific skills learned will include the use of the RStudio
integrated development environment, tidy data management practices/workflows,
how to get help in programming, and how to use GitHub to track changes in code,
disseminate professional work, and integrate feedback. Coursework will consist
of lectures, in-class group work, homework, peer assessment, and time for
discussion. This course complements graduate-level courses in statistics and
quantitative research methods by helping students develop practical skills for
conducting independent research incorporating modern data science principles.
Students completing this course will have a solid foundation enabling them to
handle complex data management tasks and data communication skills for research
and professional work.
