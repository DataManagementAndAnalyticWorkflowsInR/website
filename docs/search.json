Throughout, we will emphasize reproducibility, open science, data visualization, and dynamic document generation. Specific skills learned will include the use of the RStudio integrated development environment, tidy data management practices/workflows, how to get help in programming, and how to use GitHub to track changes in code, disseminate professional work, and integrate feedback. Coursework will consist of lectures, in-class group work, homework, peer assessment, and time for discussion. This course complements graduate-level courses in statistics and quantitative research methods by helping students develop practical skills for conducting independent research incorporating modern data science principles. Students completing this course will have a solid foundation enabling them to handle complex data management tasks and data communication skills for research and professional work.\n\n\n\n\nStudents were very happy with how the class went last winter! Here are some student testionials, shared with the students‚Äô permission:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI really enjoyed the whole learning experience in this course.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVery informative and useful. As a someone who has his first exposure to R, I learned a lot.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe teaching team were very supportive and very promptly acted on feedback.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt was wonderful! Totally friendly to R beginners. And got a lot positive feedback and encouragement from the teaching team! Shout out to their efforts!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúSlides that are managed so well! Unparellel instructional team! You are so friendly and patient! I really love that homeworks are managed through Github!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI loved this class!! So much was covered but it didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming at the same time because the expectation was that we all came in with different levels of experience with R and that these are resources we are introduced to and can always come back to.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nThis course has been excellent! It was exactly what I was looking for - I wanted to kind of catch up to my peers who have had experience in R and learn best practices. R feels a lot less intimidating now, and I know where to look for help. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\nI think this course was great. I am happy that all levels of R were welcome in the course. I felt like I could just do beginner level work and still get a good grade.\n\n\n\n\nExtremely well. I think it will be the most recommended course for whoever wants to gain skills in data management and analysis\n\n\n\nAnd lots more üôÇ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Testa 1st Year PhD Student Department of Biostatistics  ctesta@hsph.harvard.edu  GitHub   Website   Mastodon   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\nDean Marengi 3rd year PhD Student Department of Environmental Health  dean_marengi@g.harvard.edu   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\nJarvis Chen Senior Lecturer Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences  jarvis@hsph.harvard.edu   https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jarvischen/   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Hernandez  was an amazing masters student in Environmental Health who helped us develop a lot of material and helped teach the course in Winter Session 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to go to the syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1 ‚Äî Monday January 8th, 2024\nDay 2 ‚Äî Tuesday January 9th, 2024\nDay 3 ‚Äî Wednesday January 10th, 2024\nDay 4 ‚Äî Thursday January 11th, 2024\nDay 5 ‚Äî Friday January 12th, 2024\n(MLK Jr.¬†Day on Monday January 15th)\nDay 6 ‚Äî Tuesday January 16th, 2024\nDay 7 ‚Äî Wednesday January 17th, 2024\nDay 8 ‚Äî Thursday January 18th, 2024\nDay 9 ‚Äî Friday January 19th, 2024\n\n\n<div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\">\n<p><span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-sidebar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Home\">Home</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Syllabus\">Syllabus</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Curriculum\">Curriculum</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 1\">Day 1</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 2\">Day 2</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 3\">Day 3</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 4\">Day 4</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 5\">Day 5</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 6\">Day 6</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 7\">Day 7</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 8\">Day 8</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 9\">Day 9</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Last Years&#39;

2021 Brown et al published an article titled A Reproduction of the Results of Onyike et al.¬†(2003) in Meta-Psychology, a journal that is free, open-access and conducts open peer review. The Onikye et al.¬†article they reproducing, Is obesity associated with major depression? Results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology has been cited 1159+ times according to Google Scholar.\nI want to point out an interesting section from the About page describing the Meta-Psychology journal that you might keep in mind as you read on:\n\nPrior to publication, all statistical analyses are reproduced by our statistical reproduction team, which consists of the Statistical Editor and our editorial assistant. This makes the article eligible for the reproducibility badge.\n\nRecommended Reading\nPlease read the article by Brown et al (https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/2071).\nAbstract repeated here as a teaser:\n\nOnyike et al.¬†(2003) analyzed data from a large-scale US-American data set, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III), and reported an association between obesity and major depression, especially among people with severe obesity. Here, we report the results of a detailed replication of Onyike et al.‚Äôs analyses. While we were able to reproduce the majority of these authors‚Äô descriptive statistics, this took a substantial amount of time and effort, and we found several minor errors in the univariate descriptive statistics reported in their Tables 1 and 2. We were able to reproduce most of Onyike et al.‚Äôs bivariate findings regarding the relationship between obesity and depression (Tables 3 and 4), albeit with some small discrepancies (e.g., with respect to the magnitudes of standard errors). On the other hand, we were unable to reproduce Table 5, containing Onyike et al.‚Äôs findings with respect to the relationship between obesity and depression when controlling for plausible confounding variables‚Äîarguably the paper‚Äôs most important results‚Äîbecause some of the included predictor variables appear to be either unavailable, or not coded in the way reported by Onyike et al., in the public NHANES-III data sets. We discuss the implications of our findings for the transparency of reporting and the reproducibility of published results.\n\nTheir code is freely, publicly accessible on OSFHOME, a file storage service provided by the Open Science Framework from the Center for Open Science.\n\nBrown et al‚Äôs code+file repository: https://osf.io/j32yw/\nDownload their code+files (direct link): https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/j32yw/providers/osfstorage/?zip=\n\nNote that in order to run their code, you will either want to a) make a new R project in the folder with their code on your computer, or b) open a new RStudio window, open up their .R file, and use setwd('filepath/goes/here/') to make sure your R session can run their R code.\nConsider the following questions:\n\nDo you believe that the results Brown et al.¬†have shared are more likely to be correct than those that Onikye et al published? If so, why? If not, why not?\n\nWhat do you find compelling about their re-analysis and code?\nWhat do you find lacking about their re-analysis and code?\n\nHow do you think the non-reproducibility of Onikye et al.‚Äôs article could have been avoided?\nWhen, if at all, do you think articles should be required to share code and data?\n\nWhat about in situations where the data relates to private or sensitive data?\nWhat about in situations where the subject matter is highly politically charged and there might be malicious actors who could see shared data and code as additional surface area to attack?\n\nHas reading this article made you more skeptical of research publications that don‚Äôt share code?\nDo you think for articles where code & data are too sensitive to be shared, is there an alternative process that would make you similarly confident in the stated results?\n\nAn important aside\nThis isn‚Äôt a class about stigma and health, but I think being in a Population Health Science program, it‚Äôs important to leave the breadcrumbs here for you to do your own followup reading and learning.\nBecause the articles in this homework discuss body-weight and health, I want to emphatically point out that this subject matter is not at all cut and dry. It‚Äôs important to acknowledge that:\n\nWeight-based stigma is real and causes harm to health through multiple mechanisms including at least discrimination and health care practitioners‚Äô attitudes and behaviors:\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.159491\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12266\n\nThe decision by health organizations to classify obesity as a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù is debated:\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/is-obesity-a-disease\n\nThe language and terminology that we use can perpetuate stigma:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5051141/?report=classic\nhttps://news.yale.edu/2012/07/12/choosing-words-wisely-when-talking-patients-about-their-weight\n\n\nIf anything, what I hope you take away from this aside is that data do not speak for themselves, but rather are subject to interpretation and leave room for either the perpetuation or casting aside of pre-existing biases (See ‚ÄúData Never Speak for Themselves‚Äù from Nancy Krieger‚Äôs article Structural Racism, Health Inequities, and the Two-Edged Sword of Data: Structural Problems Require Structural Solutions). It‚Äôs not enough to engage with open-science practices and leverage sophisticated statistical analyses made possible in programs like R; instead, it‚Äôs necessary to combine advances in the state of the art in computing with advances in our conceptual frameworks to do science that can truly shift narratives in ways that benefit marginalized groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Year‚Äôs Video Recording"
