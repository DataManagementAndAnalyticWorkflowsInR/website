    "text": "Details:\n\nFind the course on my.harvard.edu\nCourse Hours: 1:30-5:30 PM\nClassroom: Our main classroom will be Kresge G2, but Friday 1:30-2:30, we‚Äôll be in FXB G12.\nCourse Dates:\n\nMonday January 8th - Friday January 12th,\nTuesday January 16th - Friday January 19th, 2023\n\nOffice Hours: 11:30 AM ‚Äì 12:30 PM on Wednesday January 10th, Tuesday January 16th, Thursday January 18th\nLimit 60 students, priority for Population Health Science (PHS) students\n\n\n\n\nData Management and Analytic Workflows in R will introduce students to R programming and modern data management and analysis workflows applied to examples from population health science. Throughout, we will emphasize reproducibility, open science, data visualization, and dynamic document generation. Specific skills learned will include the use of the RStudio integrated development environment, tidy data management practices/workflows, how to get help in programming, and how to use GitHub to track changes in code, disseminate professional work, and integrate feedback. Coursework will consist of lectures, in-class group work, homework, peer assessment, and time for discussion. This course complements graduate-level courses in statistics and quantitative research methods by helping students develop practical skills for conducting independent research incorporating modern data science principles. Students completing this course will have a solid foundation enabling them to handle complex data management tasks and data communication skills for research and professional work.\n\n\n\n\nStudents were very happy with how the class went last winter! Here are some student testionials, shared with the students‚Äô permission:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI really enjoyed the whole learning experience in this course.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVery informative and useful. As a someone who has his first exposure to R, I learned a lot.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe teaching team were very supportive and very promptly acted on feedback.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt was wonderful! Totally friendly to R beginners. And got a lot positive feedback and encouragement from the teaching team! Shout out to their efforts!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúSlides that are managed so well! Unparellel instructional team! You are so friendly and patient! I really love that homeworks are managed through Github!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI loved this class!! So much was covered but it didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming at the same time because the expectation was that we all came in with different levels of experience with R and that these are resources we are introduced to and can always come back to.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nThis course has been excellent! It was exactly what I was looking for - I wanted to kind of catch up to my peers who have had experience in R and learn best practices. R feels a lot less intimidating now, and I know where to look for help. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\nI think this course was great. I am happy that all levels of R were welcome in the course. I felt like I could just do beginner level work and still get a good grade.\n\n\n\n\nExtremely well. I think it will be the most recommended course for whoever wants to gain skills in data management and analysis\n\n\n\nAnd lots more üôÇ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Testa 1st Year PhD Student Department of Biostatistics  ctesta@hsph.harvard.edu  GitHub   Website   Mastodon   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\nDean Marengi 3rd year PhD Student Department of Environmental Health  dean_marengi@g.harvard.edu   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\nJarvis Chen Lecturer Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences  jarvis@hsph.harvard.edu   https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jarvischen/   Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Hernandez  was an amazing masters student in Environmental Health who helped us develop a lot of material and helped teach the course in Winter Session 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to go to the syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1 ‚Äî Monday January 8th, 2024\nDay 2 ‚Äî Tuesday January 9th, 2024\nDay 3 ‚Äî Wednesday January 10th, 2024\nDay 4 ‚Äî Thursday January 11th, 2024\nDay 5 ‚Äî Friday January 12th, 2024\n(MLK Jr.¬†Day on Monday January 15th)\nDay 6 ‚Äî Tuesday January 16th, 2024\nDay 7 ‚Äî Wednesday January 17th, 2024\nDay 8 ‚Äî Thursday January 18th, 2024\nDay 9 ‚Äî Friday January 19th, 2024\n\n\n<div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\">\n<p><span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-sidebar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar-title\">ID529: Data Management and Analytic Workflows in R</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Home\">Home</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Syllabus\">Syllabus</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Curriculum\">Curriculum</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Day 1 ‚Äî Monday January 8, 2024\">Day 1 ‚Äî Monday January 8, 2024</span> <span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-navbar:Last Years&#39;
